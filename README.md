### Contributing:
When inserting paragraph blocks, set a right margin at index 160 and don't go over. In VSCode, you can do this by modifying `settings.json` to set 
`"editor.rulers": [160]`.

### Debugging:
To run an instance of the website locally (which you should always do before pushing changes to git), use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` and go to url `localhost:8000`.
